## Commands:

> /lmc __user__ _message_<p>_Sends a LabyMod message to the selected user of your friendlist._</p>
> /lmr _message_</b><p>_Sends a message to last user names in /lmc_</p>

The syntax for both commands can now be changed in the addons settings.

### New in 1.3
You can now put UUIDs instead of names in the custom command input field to prevent the syntax from working when
your friends change their name.

> df66f7ab-d5eb-4d25-8d95-0d65bec4caee anti;LabyStudio laby boi;

(Ingame commands will stay the same)

### New in 1.2
You are now able to make custom commands for friends within the ingame settings. You can see the syntax on this example:

> Antimoxs anti;LabyStudio laby boi;

Ingame commands matching the syntax:
> /anti _message_<p>
> /laby boi _message_
